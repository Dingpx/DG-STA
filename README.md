## Introduction

We propose a Dynamic Graph-Based Spatial-Temporal Attention (DG-STA) method for hand gesture recognition. The key idea is to first construct a fully-connected graph from a hand skeleton, where the node features and edges are then automatically learned via a self-attention mechanism that performs in both spatial and temporal domains. The code of training our approach for skeleton-based hand gesture recognition on the [DHG-14/28 Dataset](http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/DHGdataset/) and the [SHRECâ€™17 Track Dataset](http://www-rech.telecom-lille.fr/shrec2017-hand/) is provided in this repository.
